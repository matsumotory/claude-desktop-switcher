/// Account/session isolation is achieved purely by per-profile directories:
/// the Desktop app is launched with `--user-data-dir` and the CLI runs with
/// `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` pointing at the profile's own directories. Each profile
/// keeps its own login inside its own directory, so CSW never reads, writes, or
/// deletes Keychain credentials.
///
/// This was verified empirically: a fresh `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` reports
/// `loggedIn: false` independently of the default profile, i.e. Claude Code
/// scopes its credentials per config directory. Likewise the Desktop app keeps
/// its session inside its `--user-data-dir`. Copying secrets out of the OS
/// Keychain into files would only weaken security without being necessary, so
/// that mechanism has been removed.
